# Retailer activity metric + Distributor dashboard polish

## Goal
1. Split Activity Status on Distributor Dashboard (transacted vs no-activity this month — same logic as existing).
2. Rename downline **Collect/Debit** button label to **Reverse**.
3. Month-wise history: Total / Transacted / No Activity per past month.
4. Move Quick Actions higher (below Main Balance / Retailer Overview).
