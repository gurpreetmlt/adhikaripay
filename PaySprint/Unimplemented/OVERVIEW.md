## Positioning (provider)

PaySprint is a NexGen banking fintech **Unified Open API** platform for B2B partners (startups, MSMEs, NBFCs, BCs, enterprises). Banks & travel partners remain custodians of customers/products; PaySprint provides API distribution.

### Benefits (provider marketing)

- Open platform bringing solutions together
- Faster integration / paperless onboarding
- Choose your bank
- Value-added services + dedicated support
- Single dashboard / plug-and-play
- **Common wallet** for transactions

### Getting started (provider)

1. Review API documentation
2. Obtain UAT credentials (JWT, AES, PartnerId, Authorisedkey)
3. Whitelist India IP / host in India
4. Integrate JWT auth → call Balance / product APIs
5. Go Live (credentials differ; Authorisedkey not needed on Live per auth page)

### Gotchas

- Getting Started page is marketing — no REST endpoint.
- BBPS / Recharge / Insurance mentioned but **not** covered in Doc 1/2 extracts → need separate PDFs.
- Do not mix InstantPay rails with PaySprint — different auth (JWT vs InstantPay headers).
